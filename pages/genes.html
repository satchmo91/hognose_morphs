    <div class="center text_2">Here is a description of the genes and how they change the appearance of the snake.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <br>
    <div id="geneListContainer">
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Albino</div>
            <div>The albino gene in hognose snakes is a genetic mutation that affects the snake's pigmentation. Snakes with the albino gene lack the ability to produce melanin, which is responsible for the dark coloration typically seen in their wild counterparts. As a result, hognose snakes with this gene exhibit a distinctive appearance characterized by a lack of black or brown pigmentation. Instead, they typically display a lighter, pale yellow or orange coloration with patterns in shades of pink, peach, or cream. The albino also gives the snake red eyes. This genetic mutation is recessive, meaning both parents must carry the albino gene for it to be expressed in their offspring.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Arctic</div>
            <div>Arctic hognose snakes typically exhibit a pale and silvery base coloration. Their patterns and markings may be reduced, appearing as faint gray or white shades, giving them a crisp and icy appearance. The eyes of Arctic hognose snakes may also have a distinct bluish or grayish hue.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Axanthic</div>
            <div>Axanthic hognose snakes typically have a dark base coloration, often black or charcoal gray. Their patterns and markings may appear in various shades of gray, silver, or white. The reduction of yellow and red pigments can cause the snake's overall appearance to be more monochromatic, giving it a subdued and often strikingly contrasted look.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Caramel</div>
            <div>Caramel hognose snakes typically display a rich, warm brown coloration that resembles the shade of caramel or butterscotch. Their base color can vary from light to dark caramel tones, often with a smooth and even distribution across their body. The patterns and markings on caramel hognose snakes may be slightly darker or lighter than the base color, creating a subtle contrast.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Conda</div>
            <div>Hognose snakes with the Conda morph typically exhibit a distinctive "condensed" or "compressed" appearance, often with a thick and stocky body. The pattern on their scales may be irregular, broken, or reduced, giving them a more solid or blotchy appearance compared to traditional hognose snakes. The Conda morph can be found in different color variations, including combinations with other morphs such as albino or axanthic. This can lead to a wide range of color patterns and intensities within the Conda morph.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Dutch Hypo</div>
            <div>Dutch Hypo hognose snakes display a hypo pattern combined with unique coloration and markings. They typically have reduced pigmentation and exhibit a distinct pattern with lighter colors.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Extreme Red</div>
            <div>Extreme Red hognose snakes have vibrant red coloration that is intensified compared to typical hognose snakes. They showcase a deep red hue throughout their body.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Granite</div>
            <div>No description yet.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Green Hypo</div>
            <div>Green Hypo hognose snakes combine the hypo mutation with green coloration. They typically have reduced pigmentation and exhibit shades of green, ranging from light to darker hues.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Hypo</div>
            <div>Hypo hognose snakes have reduced pigmentation compared to wild-type hognose snakes. They often display lighter colors and patterns, resulting in a visually striking appearance.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Jag</div>
            <div>Jag hognose snakes exhibit a distinctive pattern characterized by irregular, jagged-edged markings. </div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Lavender</div>
            <div>Lavender hognose snakes have a soft lavender or purplish hue to their overall coloration.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Lemon Ghost</div>
            <div>No description yet.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Leucistic</div>
            <div>Leucistic hognose snakes lack all pigmentation, resulting in an almost completely white appearance. They have pink or blue eyes and lack the typical patterns and coloration seen in wild-type hognose snakes.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Mocha</div>
            <div>Mocha hognose snakes have a rich, brown coloration reminiscent of the shade of mocha. This morph showcases a dark and chocolatey appearance.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Pink Pastel</div>
            <div>Pink Pastel hognose snakes exhibit a soft and delicate pink coloration. They often have lighter shades of pink combined with reduced patterns.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Pistachio</div>
            <div> Pistachio hognose snakes showcase a greenish coloration reminiscent of the shade of pistachio.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Purple Line</div>
            <div>Purple Line hognose snakes exhibit a distinct line or stripe pattern along their body, showcasing purple hues.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">RBE Pastel</div>
            <div>No description yet</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Sable</div>
            <div>Sable hognose snakes showcase a dark and rich brown or blackish coloration.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Shadow</div>
            <div>Shadow hognose snakes exhibit a unique and darker coloration compared to wild-type hognose snakes.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Super-Arctic</div>
            <div>Super-Arctic is the super form of the Arctic gene meaning that the snake inherited arctic from both parents. They typically exhibit an enhanced arctic appearance, with light coloration and reduced patterns.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Super-Conda</div>
            <div>Super-Conda is the super form of the conda gene, meaning that the snake inherited the conda gene from both parents. Super-condas are almost completely patternless except for their head stamp and sometimes a faint line down the back of the snake.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Swiss Chocolate</div>
            <div>Swiss Chocolate hognose snakes showcase a rich, dark brown coloration reminiscent of Swiss chocolate.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Tiger</div>
            <div>Tiger hognose snakes exhibit a unique pattern resembling tiger stripes.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Toffee</div>
            <div>Toffee hognose snakes have a caramel or toffee-like coloration.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Twinspot</div>
            <div>This is a pattern morph that reduces the stripes on the hognose and instead displays pairs of spots down the snake's body.</div>
        <div class="geneTitle text_2">Wild</div>
            <div>This is not a morph, but the baseline for hognose snakes. Wild or "Normal" hognose snakes appear as they do in the wild without any selective breeding. They still have plenty of variety in pattern and color, though, and are all unique in their own ways.</div>
